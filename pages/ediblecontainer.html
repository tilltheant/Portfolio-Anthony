              In this year's Minor we will be participating in the *Biodesign challenge to use 
              living organisms such as mycelium to tackle a problem and create new alternatives or solutions in this case edible containers.
              <br>
              <br>
              *Biodesign Challenge is an education program and competition that is shaping 
              the first generation of biodesigners. BDC partners high school and university students 
              with scientists, artists, and designers to envision, create, and critique transformational applications in biotech.

            <h3>Framing: Design from another angle</h3>
            <p>
            

              The issue we came across was the way festivals use non biodegradable materials for 
              different types of consumptions. Such as cups, cutlery and even plastic wraps for food. 
              Kwaku festival is one of these festivals where food and coming together is the main goal. 
              Not only is this culture very present here but also the single-use containers used carry your food in.
              <br>
              <br>
              With this in mind and the kwaku festival which is also our community we focus on. 
              Since we are both surinamese we want to give back to our community and better the world not by only 
              lowering single-use plastics on festivals such as kwaku but also give an example to the rest of the
              world that there are other more sustainable and environmentally friendly ways.
              <br>
              <br>
              With our community in mind and the knowledge of finding something that is 
              already accepted in our community we have a steady motivation to find ideas 
              that fit well into this picture.
              <br>
              <br>
              This brings up the question; Is there a way we could 
              introduce a new product as an alternative (not a replacement) for 
              these non biodegradable materials (like plastic)?
            </p>

            <h3>Surinamese culture and tempeh</h3>
            <p>
              Inspired by our own culture we see opportunities in the way tempeh is integrated in the already 
              delicious food made by our own families and communities, this is the reason why tempeh is the best 
              candidate for making our own edible container. Because the threshold to eat tempeh as part of the meal
              already has connections that is perceived as positive in the culture, by making the link to edible 
              containers made from tempeh more easily accepted. Thus the integration will go more smoothly and fits 
              so well into the menu.</p>
