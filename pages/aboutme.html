        <h1>Hi, I'm Anthony. Yes the guy on the picture!</h1>
        <p class="intro">
          In my casual life you can find me on rollerskates cruising
          away on the boulevard with some funky beats in my headphones.
          Rollerskating is one of my passions and just like in everything I do I
          strive to learn new skills and tricks all the time. Instead of my
          leasure time though I would like to write here more about my
          professional life.
          <br />
        </p>
        <h2>Some more Anthony for you!</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Currently I am still studying Communication and Multimedia Design at
          the Hogeschool van Amsterdam (HvA). This school year, 2021 - 2022, will
          be my last year after which I am expected to start my internship. I am
          looking for an internship in the field of frontend development,
          creative design and/or design research as well as the UI/UX design.
          That's also the reason behind this website - to let you and others
          know about my skills and perhaps I can contribute to and learn from
          your business, I believe life is an learning process!
          <br />
          <br />
          People who know me usually describe me as a spontaneous guy with lots
          of vibrant ideas and a laid back but engaging attitude. I shine best
          when given to chance to work in team with other (not only) creative
          minds when we can motivate, inspire and challenge one another. I find
          it fascinating to observe and get to know other people's approaches
          to various professional challenges (like for instance design tweaks or
          functional tasks). I use applications like Adobe Illustrator,
          Photoshop and Figma very often and that's also where my strenghts
          reside. Next to that I find developing front end elements in various
          frameworks like for example Vue.

          <br />
          <br />
          I hope you learned something about me, I bet you just did!
